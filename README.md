#### "Ima use this in my app..."
Oh, you sweet summer child. Introducing Metal to SwiftUI workflow requires the same level of care and attention you'd give to adopting a rescue hyena. Have fun, but proceed with caution. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

#### "This approach could be more efficient!"
Absolutely it can! In multiple ways. This is a proof of concept I put together over a couple of lunches during WWDC 2022. There's plenty of room for improvement and I have a short attention span. Run wild and make it better. Or stare in wonder at the waste of a perfectly good GPU. ü´†
